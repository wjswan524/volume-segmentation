# This Python script serves two primary functions:
# Import and segment a single slice of a micro-CT scan using Otsu Nobuyuki's
#   thresholding method.
# Calculate porosity via pixel counting of the binarized image.

import cv2
import skimage
from skimage import filters
import imageio
from PIL import Image

im = imageio.imread('C:/Users/wjswa/Documents/Micro-CT scans/81/4x_81_Export0001.tif')
print(type(im))

gray = skimage.color.rgb2gray(im)

# There is black space surrounding each image, which must be cropped out. The cropping
#   parameters here are specific to the scan being used.
cropped = gray[175:825,175:825]

# Now we create a mask using Otsu's thresholding method.
val = filters.threshold_otsu(cropped)
mask = cropped < val

# Finally, we transform the array yielded by Otsu's method into a grayscale image and
#   use the histogram to compare void pixels to total image area.
img = Image.fromarray(mask,'L')
hist = img.histogram()

print(hist[1]/(hist[0]+hist[1]))

cv2.imwrite('C:/Users/wjswa/Documents/Test.jpg',img)
